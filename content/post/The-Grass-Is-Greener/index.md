So I came across a blog post at [Virtually Potato](https://www.virtuallypotato.com/ "Virtually Potato") about using a Git Repo, a static site generator (in this case Hugo) and free hosting from Netlify to recreate his blog from a traditional CMS or Blogging platform and decided that I would give it a go.... Man I cant believe I didn't try this sooner! I spend a lot of time in the terminal so finding something that i could mainly write from a terminal text editor as well as keep it all managed and easily accessible from any machine I may be on at the time with a GitHub Repo.
