So I use Digital Ocean Droplets to host most of my websites/web applications. I will be honest when I first came across them shortly after they opened for business I was actually not impressed.

I had horrible experience with customer support and had my account locked and my credits from the GitHub student pack that I had at the time were removed from my account before it was locked, As you can imagine I took my business elsewhere but as they matured and added features and functionalities I decided to check them out again after a friend mentioned how much they had grown.

I have to say this time around the expiernece has been much better, The support experience has been really good as well. I actually locked myself out of my account due to an issue with my email server not delivering or even any trace of it hitting my email host to get a 2FA code, they helped me get back in and then I setup real TOTP 2FA.

So on to the actual services, They have grown up a lot, Docker in the cloud, very reasonably prices droplets, turn-key applications, an awesome web front end, the list goes on. I am very impressed with all that I have been able to migrate into digital ocean that I previously had to host with my onsite docker hosts or one of my colo boxes.
