After spending the 2 years in a luxury resort environment, I moved on to take a Systems Engineer position for a small MSP based in Phoenix, AZ. I spent about 6 months in this position before finally taking a Systems Administrator position for a Growing MSP/MSSP which I started today. I am excited for the new endeavors that this position will bring.
