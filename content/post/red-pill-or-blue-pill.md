So I took the plunge over the weekend and setup a matrix homeserver, I have not gotten any of the bridges setup yet but so far I am liking the interfaces.

I still to this day use IRC heavily, as well as XMPP. Discord is also in the mix along with slack because of the usual, friends, family, etc.... but I have had an increasing interest in matrix and matter most so I decided to jump in and throw them up on one of my docker hosts. The install was pretty straight forward, using docker-compose it was a matter of less than 10 minutes.

I am going to jump further in and install the bridges and will do a comprehensive posting with a guide for setup once I get more familiar with it.



if you would like to link on my homeserver you can find me at @zippy:matrix.nbennett.xyz on https://riot.nbennett.xyz
